hey it's mark podolski

and i want to walk everyone through

the first part

of more deals and you can handle the

land geeks deal flow program

and there's going to be at least five

steps part one

is going to be

county

research

and the letter writing campaign

uh part two is going to be

getting the list

and then scrubbing your list

part three is going to be drafting your

purchase agreement

part four is going to be

sending out those offer letters and part

five is going to be waiting for those

deals to come in so these are the the

essential five steps now when it comes

to deal flow

the most important piece of this

is going to be county research there are

three thousand seven

u.s counties and then the question

becomes well how do i pick a county

and in the program there is a printable

uh the secret counties list so what is

the secret county's list why are these

counties

on this secret counties list

these are counties that i've done deals

in personally

my competition have done deals and

personally

as well as our land geek coaching

clients and students

so we definitively know there are deals

to be done there that is not to say that

this won't work

in other counties

but my question to you

is as someone who's starting out

one you rather start in a county that

you know definitively you are going to

get deals

so that's why we have the secret

counties list now i can hear people

thinking to themselves well

if everyone's going

to say pueblo county colorado isn't that

going to saturate the market and there's

going to be too much competition so i'm

not going to go to any of those counties

on the secret county's list well this is

the reality

there are billions of acres of land

and there are relatively very few land

investors you and i will run out of

money before we run out of deal flow

i've personally made millions of dollars

in three counties

three counties

one in colorado two in nevada three

counties jeff axton is working one

county he's over ten thousand dollars a

month in passive income

working this business part time scott

todd works about three or four counties

you don't need to work

eight counties ten counties and you

certainly don't need to

go off on your own

trailblaze your own

secret county

and find out that you're not getting any

deal flow billy rogers was just at boot

camp and he was telling his story and

how he got started in the business and

he said the biggest mistake he made

was thinking that

those counties would be saturated here

at county's list so he went to a county

in his uh backyard he didn't get any

deals and then he finally listened to us

started going through the program

following it step by step and mailing to

our counties and then he started getting

deals

and and working the business and doing

very very well so

that is going to be the first piece is

county research so the best place to

start is going to be honestly your

secret counties list

and then you want to

dig a little bit deeper and you can go

to lands of america.com

landmodo.com lanflip.com

and just kind of get an idea of

um what's going on in that county how

many listings there are uh the certain

areas uh as scott todd likes to say

success leaves clues you can also go to

my website scott's website and just see

where are we working and

in those areas so those are those are

never a bad place to start but if we

don't get our county research correct

from day one

we're gonna have a problem because even

if you have the best pricing

um even if you have the best marketing

even if you have the best sales

it won't matter

if you aren't in a good county that

there's no deals so for example

if you go to let's say san francisco

well no one's going to sell you a

million dollar info lot 30 cents on the

dollar right they're going to go to a

a broker to do that deal

and so this counties are areas that are

more rural they're maybe two to three

hours from the closest city maybe even

closer

but there's thousands of lots

and billions of acres available

in those counties for us to buy

and we can typically buy them 20 30

cents on the dollar so

county research is critical it's

absolutely critical and there's other

places and other websites you can go to

besides google to learn more about the

county you can go to

naconaco.org as well and get all the

information

from a county there

and there's there's other sites as well

such as

a site like

bestplaces.net

there's going to be other sites for

research i don't want to overwhelm you

and i don't want you drinking from a

fire hose so

let's just stop here and

just reiterate

county research in our first video the

number one thing you want to do is go to

the secret counties list and we know

definitively that deals can be done

there

right do not be a trailblazer success

leaves clues

we know for sure either i've done deals

there my competition has done deals or

my students have done deals there don't

go out and start thinking like scarcity

mentality that oh

there must not be any deals there if uh

if all these people are going to the

same counties it's not true

and

make sure that you get your county

research solid

get one to two counties first and then

let's talk about

getting the list in our next video
